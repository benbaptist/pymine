According to this ancient README file, your only hope is to destroy the original were-car.

Milestones in development:
- Getting our first packet to be parsed (done)
- Getting minecraft passed "Logging in..." and "Downloading terrain" and into the 3D view
- Reading MCRegion files and NBT files
- Finishing adding every block type

Goals:
- Allowing plugins to add blocks, entities and mobs, etc.
- Getting the basics of the server complete BEFORE Minecraft Beta 1.8 is released


EVENTS (out of order and not much thought put into):
BLOCK_PLACE - when a block is placed
BLOCK_DESTORY - when a block is destroyed 
PLAYER_DEATH - when a player dies
